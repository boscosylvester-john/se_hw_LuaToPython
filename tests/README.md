I. test_csv() --
This function contains a row function that takes inputs "row" and "n". Here row indicates a tuple or a complete row of the csv file on which we are operating and n indicates the number of elements contained in the row.
Specifically, we are showing all the values of the first 10 rows of the csv.

II. test_data() --
Similar to test_csv(), instead of printing every row, we are now printing every column of the csv. The input taken here is the list of all the columns one by one.

III. test_num() --
This function checks if the median function and the standard deviation methods work perfectly. The way to check this is to make sure that the value in the range 50 to 52 should apply to median and 30.5 to 32 for standard deviation.

IV. test_bignum() --
Instead of testing normal numbers as stated in test_num(), here we are testing large numbers of much higher range.

V. test_sym() --
Here, we are testing the symbols class by providing a sample list of symbols i.e. single english letters and testing out the median and standard deviation methods on the sample input set. The output will confirm the correctness of both the methods

VI. test_the() --
It tests the "the" dictionary on sample values
