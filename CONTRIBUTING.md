## Question?

> Hopefully the [README.md](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/blob/main/README.md) answers any questions you may have, but if not, here are a few things you can do:
- Look through the [Issues](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/issues) section to see if your query has been answered previously. If you aren't satisfied with the explanation/answer - you can add on your doubts as a reply to the issue.
- If you want to create a new issue for a previously unaddressed question, we suggest you to follow the given steps:
    - Open an [Issue](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/issues/new).
    - Write in detail about the problem and specify the code if possible.
- The internet! - If you don't find help in any of the issues nor the documentation. We suggest you look throught the internet. Stackoverflow or framework documentations could be a real help!
We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
## How to Contribute:
### Reporting Bugs
For reporting a bug, refer to the [Question?] part

Guidelines while reporting bugs:
1. **Use the GitHub search** : check if the issue has already been found and reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been resolved** : Pull it and run it to see if it resolves the bug you are trying to report
3. **Isolate the problem** : create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

Things to remember while reporting a bug:
1. It should have enough information so that other people don't have to ask you persistently.
2. You should make sure you have checked versioning, SDK requirements, IDE, OS, size, browser requirements etc. before concluding that it is indeed a bug.
    Eg: 'It works on others systems and not mine' is not valid.

### Adding your Code

Steps to add code to this repository:

1. Open a pull request
2. Make sure you only work on code after it has been made evident in the issues that a bug has not been fixed and you can better it.
3. The changes you have made should be tested well and good and passed before being committed.
4. Your commits should not be too many - Keep your commit history brief!
5. Sell you code in the description of the PR and convince as to why we should add it.

### Enhancing the README
As this is an example project meant for homework purposes, the README.md will be short and brief. Yet, there are ways in which the README can be enhanced:

1. Styling
2. Organizing content by means of tabularizing, aligning etc.
3. Adding Media! Images, Videos, GIFS
4. Adding Analytics that may help other coders
5. Adding latest information that has been added via merged pull requests.

## Commit Messages
Follow a few of these simple rules while creating a commit message for your code contribution:
- Limit the subject line to 5-6 words
- Capitalize the subject line
- Limit the body to 9-10 words
- In the body, describe what you have done and optionally, why
